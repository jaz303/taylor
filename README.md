# taylor

Taylor is an __experimental__ package manager and build tool for Apple's Swift programming language, developed to explore the possibilities for growing a module ecosystem around the language. It's similar to tools like `npm` and `lein`.

So far, `taylor` supports:

  * Creation of packages
  * Installation of modules directly from Git repositories
  * Building projects

Taylor rides on top of `make(1)` and other CLI tools; it is not an Xcode project generator.

Read on for installation instructions and a tutorial project. [Follow me on Twitter](http://twitter.com/jaz303) to keep up with development progress.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

  1. Install node.js. Any recent version should do.
  2. `taylor` assumes that Xcode6 Beta is installed in the default location (`/Applications/Xcode6-Beta.app`). If this is not the case, define the environment variable `TAYLOR_SWIFT_TOOLCHAIN` to point to the `Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain` subdirectory within wherever Xcode is installed.

All set? Let's go:

```
$ npm install -g taylor
```

(depending on your configuration the above command may require `sudo`)

## Tutorial

## Technical Details

## Command Reference

#### `taylor create <package>`

Create a new package

#### `taylor create-module <package>`

#### `taylor install <module>`

#### `taylor build [<target>]`

Build `target`.

If `target` is unspecified, all targets will be built.

#### `taylor run [<target>]`

Run the executable generated by `target`; this must be an `app` target.

If unspecified, `target` will default to the package's first available `app` target.

#### `taylor clean`

Delete all build products. Does not remove Makefiles or any other files created by `taylor regen`.

#### `taylor zap`

Recursively delete all build products, Makefiles and any other generated files, including those contained within installed modules. Use this command to force a fresh build of your entire project tree.

Be warned, this command is somewhat indiscriminate and will delete any `build` directory it encounters, regardless of whether it was created by Taylor or not.

#### `taylor make <target>`

Low level command; run an explicit `make` target inside Taylor's environment.

#### `taylor regen`

Force regeneration of the current package's Makefile and any other supporting files required by the build process.

#### `taylor invalidate`

Delete the current package's Makefile and any other supporting files required by the build process.

#### `taylor config`

Dump all of Taylor's effective configuration variables to the console.

#### `taylor env`

Dump Taylor's entire environment to the console.

## Current Limitations

(aka missing features that you'd expect in a real package manager/build tool)

### Easy

These features can each be added in &lte; 1 day:

  - Build profiles e.g. "debug", "release"
  - Allow targets to explicit state their dependent source files

### Medium

These are a little harder:

  - Test running
  - Linking against external (C) libraries

### Hard

And thse will be somewhat time-consuming:

  - Automatic dependency resolution/installation!
  - Central package registry
