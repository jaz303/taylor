# taylor

## Installation

### Prerequisites

`taylor` assumes that Xcode6 Beta is installed in the default location (`/Applications/Xcode6-Beta.app`). If this is not the case, define the environment variable `TAYLOR_SWIFT_TOOLCHAIN` to point to the `Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain` subdirectory within wherever Xcode is installed.

```
$ npm install -g taylor
```

## Tutorial

## Missing features that you'd expect in a real package manager/build tool

  - Automatic dependency resolution/installation!
  - Central package registry
  - Test running
  - Build profiles e.g. "debug", "release"
